## Getting started

Many combinatorial optimization problems are conveniently expressed using a constraint-based modeling language. They are then solved by powerful constraint programming or mathematical programming solvers.

We provide support for over-constrained problems or problems where desirable properties can be modeled as optional (soft) constraints. Importance is expressed only by means of relations between constraints (see [this slide](http://www.isse.uni-augsburg.de/software/minibrass/constraint-relationships.pdf) to get an idea). Our library extensions are built on top of [MiniZinc](http://www.minizinc.org) that facilitates modeling combinatorial optimization problems for various solvers. The library includes:

* Convenient expression of soft constraint problems using constraint relationships
* Automatic translation to weighted CSP
* Generic search heuristics
* Consistency checks of the specified relationships

## Quick Example

### Docs

Docs are [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) of pages stored under `_docs` folder. To create a new page:

**1.** Create a new constraint model

```
include "classic_o.mzn"; % output of minibrass
include "soft_constraints/pvs_gen_search.mzn"; 

% the basic, "classic" CSP 
set of int: DOM = 1..3;

var DOM: x; var DOM: y; var DOM: z;

solve 
:: int_search([x,y,z], input_order, indomain_min, complete)
search pvs_BAB();

```

**2.** Create a new preference model
```
include "defs.mbr";

PVS: cr1 = new ConstraintPreferences("cr1") {
   soft-constraint c1: 'x + 1 = y';
   soft-constraint c2: 'z = y + 2';
   soft-constraint c3: 'x + y <= 3';
   
   crEdges : '[| mbr.c2, mbr.c1 | mbr.c3, mbr.c1 |]';
   useSPD: 'false' ;
}; 

solve cr1;
output '["x = \(x); y = \(y); z = \(z)"]';
```

### Blog posts

Add a new Markdown file such as `2017-05-09-my-post.md` and write the content similar to other post examples.

### Pages

The home page is located under `index.html` file. You can change the content or design completely different welcome page for your taste. (You can use [bootstrap componenets](http://getbootstrap.com/components/))

In order to add a new page, create a new html or markdown file under root directory and link it in `_includes/topnav.html`.
